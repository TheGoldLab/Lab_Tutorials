    <p>I'm aiming for a major revision, called Version 1. I expect to finish it by April, 2012. The big goals for 1.0 are:</p>
<p>Full agreement among project areas, including code base, documentation, and project site.<br />
Full agreement with Tower of Psych Version 1<br />
Resolution of outstanding project issues, removal of stale issues<br />
Good explanation of project components, and how to access components individually, without requiring the whole enchilada<br />
Installer to easily get Version 1 by name (no need to know about repository tags, trunk etc.)<br />
Expectation of long-term stability<br />
This page contains my laundry list of changes to Snow Dots. I'll keep a similar for Tower of Psych</p>
<p>January2010</p>
<p>The first goal is to complete the changes in the January2012 milestone.</p>
<p>This was done at the end of January, 2012.</p>
<p>Foundation</p>
<p>With fewer singletons to worry about, I want to flatten the singletons/ and superclasses/ folders into the foundation/ folder</p>
<p>(small)</p>
<p>As of January2012, these folders are gone.</p>
<p>Mex</p>
<p>I want to Remove mexUDPMxGram, since it's never used.</p>
<p>(small)</p>
<p>As of r892, mexUDPMxGram is gone.</p>
<p>Demos</p>
<p>Demos should agree with all the changes up to Version 1.</p>
<p>Revise and recomment 2afc demo<br />
As of r892, 2afc demo is reimplemented to use topsEnsmbles.<br />
Revise and recomment dotris demo<br />
did this.<br />
Revise and recomment plexon integration demo<br />
Actually, I removed this because it wasn't much of a "task"<br />
Remove squares demo<br />
As of r892, the squares is replaced with SquareTagPlus.<br />
(big - 2 days)</p>
<p>Demos were reimplemented in March 2012.</p>
<p>Code Style</p>
<p>Class members that are intuitively "internal" to a class should all use the SetAccess = protected or Access = protected modifier. That way members are viewable but won't get messed with by accident. Now, there's a mix of access modifiers and hidden status, for no good reason.</p>
<p>(small)</p>
<p>Made uniform style around member access as of r924.</p>
<p>Singletons</p>
<p>Snow Dots does not need so many singletons. They cause headaches with managing global state. In addition to removal of manager singletons (in January2012):</p>
<p>Move shared defaults from TheSwitchboard to TheMachineConfiguration<br />
Remove TheSwitchboard, since no more windowNumber or pixelsPerDegree<br />
TheScreen must work via dotsClientEnsemble (instead of dotsTheDrawablesManager)<br />
As of January2012, this works, and dotsTheDrawablesManager is gone.<br />
(big - 1 day)</p>
<p>As of r934, all this is done</p>
<p>Readables</p>
<p>I want to make a dotsReadableEyeEyelink class, based on the MGL Eyelink API. But I'll but leave testing up to someone with Eyelink hardware.</p>
<p>(small)</p>
<p>r945 contains an implementation of dotsQueryableEyeEyelink.<br />
Utilities</p>
<p>Utilities can be pruned and reorganized.</p>
<p>MGLFlushGauge -&gt; dotsMglFlushGauge<br />
Did in r936.<br />
Remove checkUDPSnowDots, since unclear and old<br />
As of r892, checkUDPSnowDots is gone.<br />
Remove resetTheSingletons, since only two singletons left<br />
As of r937, resetTheSingletons is gone.<br />
Remove repeatAllDotsTests, since no more global modes.<br />
As of January2012, repeatAllDotsTests is gone.<br />
ApplyClockDriftAndOffset -&gt; clockDriftApply<br />
Did in r936.<br />
EstimateClockDriftAndOffset -&gt; clockDriftEstimate<br />
Did in r936.<br />
Reimplement benchmarkDOutStrobedWords to use ensembles<br />
done, became benchmarkDOutPlexon, in r943.<br />
Implement utilities that can do remote data log updating, (via an ensemble)<br />
r947 contains new dotsDataLogUtilities for doing log updates and writing, via ensembles.<br />
(big - 1 day)</p>
<p>done, as of r947</p>
<p>Tests</p>
<p>I'll need to rename several unit tests to agree with 1.0.</p>
<p>for r950 I reviewed test suite names and updated just one</p>
<p>(small)</p>
<p>Issues</p>
<p>The issues database has become stale and clumsy.</p>
<p>Close issues solved in 1.0<br />
All issues reviewed as of 26 March 2012.<br />
No-Solve other issues with a note<br />
I did this on 8 Jan<br />
(small)</p>
<p>I didn't close all the issues, but the remaining issues are somewhat nebulous and low-priority.</p>
<p>userProjects/</p>
<p>I should reimplement predictiveInference for Version 1.</p>
<p>(big - 1 day)</p>
<p>The predictive inference task is updated as of r971</p>
<p>Installer</p>
<p>The installer should be easier to point at a named version, like "Version 1". Also, it should be a complete installer as opposed to a checklist.</p>
<p>SVN checkout for Snow Dots, Tower of Psych, and MGL<br />

Build mex stuff for pnet and mex/<br />
(small)</p>
<p>r978 contains a new implementation of installSnowDots.</p>
<p>Docs</p>
<p>The role and form of the docs can be tweaked.</p>
<p>Doc front page as TOC, not as intro<br />
Focus on classes and functions as API/reference<br />
Remove confusing nav tabs<br />
(small)</p>
<p>As of r983, I updated the docs to be more focused.</p>
<p>wiki</p>
<p>The wiki needs some more explanatory content.</p>
<p>Components Page<br />
component descriptions<br />
checkout links for component folders<br />
component dependencies, like OS and hardware<br />
Components page is done as of r994<br />

ClientServerEnsemble page is done as of r1014<br />
sweet diagrams<br />
all components and collaborations/dependencies<br />
r1014 contains new components diagram.<br />
objects, ensembles and Matlab instances<br />
r1014 contains new digrams about client-server and ensembles.<br />
Page of algebra about exploding bag of money<br />
r1048 contains new a ExplosionAlgebra page.<br />
(big - 3 days)</p>
<p>Main Page</p>
<p>The main page should make better first impressions.</p>
<p>Short intro, components<br />
Short status<br />
Shouts out to related projects<br />
Several wiki pages (below the fold)<br />
(small)</p>
<p>As of 14 April 2012 Version 1 is complete!</p>
